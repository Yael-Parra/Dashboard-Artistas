# 🎨 **Painters Dashboard - Power BI Visualization**

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to **create an interactive visualization** in **Power BI** from a **dashboard** extracted from **Kaggle**. The original dataset contained information about **painters** and their works, and a data cleaning and enrichment process was carried out to enhance the visualization. Additionally, educational elements were incorporated to provide a **differential value** in storytelling.

## 🧑‍💻 **Workflow**

1. **Dataset Acquisition**:
   - The dataset was extracted from **Kaggle**, containing data about painters and their works.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Python** was used to clean the dataset.
   - The **Pandas** library was key in **filtering, transforming**, and **rearranging** the data.
   
3. **Data Enrichment**:
   - Using **Python** and **Pandas**, additional data was extracted from **the web** to enrich the dataset.
   - Relevant information about artistic styles, biographies, and birth/death dates of painters was added.

4. **Creating the Visualization**:
   - The cleaned and enriched data was imported into **Power BI**.
   - An **interactive dashboard** was designed, featuring:
     - **Trend charts** on artistic styles.
     - **Geographical distribution** of painters.
     - **Key figures** on their works and the evolution of art.

5. **Educational Touch**:
   - An **educational approach** was added to the storytelling of the dashboard to facilitate data understanding.
   - Visual elements such as **infographics** and **anecdotes** about prominent artists were implemented.

## 🚀 **Technologies Used**

- **Python** (for data cleaning and enrichment with libraries like **Pandas**)
- **Power BI** (for creating the interactive visualization)
- **Web scraping libraries** (for extracting additional data from the web)

## 🎯 **Objective**

The project aims to create a visualization that is not only **informative** but also **educational**, allowing users to explore and learn more about the history of art and its painters, all within an **interactive** and **visually appealing** environment.

## 📊 **Impact and Results**

- **Intuitive visualization** with **interactive charts** that allow the user to explore data.
- **Enrichment of information** from the web to enhance the experience.
- **Educational touch** that differentiates this project from other purely informational dashboards.

## 👩‍🎨 **Inspiration and Values**

This project was inspired by the need to **make art and painting information more accessible** to a wide audience, giving it an **educational value**. Furthermore, it was designed with the goal of **promoting inclusion** and **equity**, fostering education in technology.
